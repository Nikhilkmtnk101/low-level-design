# Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern is a **Structural Design Pattern** that facilitates the composition of objects into a tree-like structure. It enables the client code to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern provides a unified interface for both leaves (individual objects) and composites (structures composed of objects), simplifying the client code.

##Conceptual Example
1. Composite Pattern in Operating System's File System
   - Let’s try to understand the Composite pattern with an example of an operating system’s file system. In the file system, there are two types of objects: files and folders. There are cases when files and folders should be treated in the same way. This is where the Composite pattern comes in handy. 
   - Imagine that you need to run a search for a particular keyword in your file system. This search operation applies to both files and folders. For a file, it will just look into the contents of the file; for a folder, it will go through all files of that folder to find that keyword.
   
2. Composite Pattern in an Ordering System
   - Imagine your application is like a tree, with Products and Boxes as its branches. A Box can hold Products or even smaller Boxes, creating a tree-like structure. Now, think about building an ordering system where an Order includes individual products or Boxes filled with products or nested Boxes. Calculating the total price directly becomes tricky. You'd need to unwrap all nested Boxes, go through Products and Boxes, and handle various class structures.
   - Here's where the Composite pattern comes to the rescue. It suggests dealing with Products and Boxes through a common interface, using a method to calculate the total price. This method smoothly works by returning the price for a Product and, for a Box, recursively going through each item to add up the costs. This recursive approach ensures that no matter how deep the nesting goes, the total price is accurately calculated. Plus, Boxes can add extra costs like packaging expenses, making the application more adaptable and scalable. In simpler terms, the Composite pattern helps handle complex structures in your app, making it easier to calculate total prices in a flexible and efficient way.
   
# Composite Design Pattern UML Diagram

This UML diagram visually represents the structure of the Composite pattern. It illustrates how the Composite pattern is implemented in a class hierarchy, showcasing the relationships and interactions between the key elements. The diagram provides a clear overview of how composite objects, such as containers and leaf elements, are structured and how they collaborate to fulfill the design pattern's intent. The Composite pattern's UML diagram is a valuable resource for understanding the organization of classes and their roles in achieving a flexible and scalable composite structure within an application.
1. **Component:**
  - Declares the interface for objects in the composition.
  - Common operations are defined, applicable to both leaf and composite classes.

2. **Leaf:**
  - Represents individual objects in the composition.
  - Implements the operations defined in the Component interface.

3. **Composite:**
  - Represents composite objects (containers) that can contain leaves or other composites.
  - Implements the operations defined in the Component interface.
  - Contains child components.

## Problem It Solves

The Composite pattern addresses the following problems:

1. **Client Code Complexity:**
  - Dealing with complex tree structures can lead to complicated client code. The Composite pattern simplifies client code by providing a uniform interface.

2. **Treating Individual and Composite Objects Uniformly:**
  - Without the Composite pattern, treating individual and composite objects differently in client code can be challenging. This pattern allows the client to interact with both types uniformly.

## Use Cases

Use the Composite Design Pattern when:

1. **You Want to Treat Objects Uniformly:**
  - You want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, enabling clients to interact with objects without worrying about their specific types.

2. **Hierarchical Structures:**
  - Your system involves a hierarchical structure where objects can be composed of other objects, forming a part-whole hierarchy.

3. **Simplifying Client Code:**
  - You want to simplify client code that deals with complex tree structures, making it more readable and maintainable.

4. **Operations on the Whole Structure:**
  - You need to perform operations on the entire structure, and you want these operations to be applicable to both individual objects and compositions.
